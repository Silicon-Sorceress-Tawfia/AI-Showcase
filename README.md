## 🚀 Shadow Puppet Simulator

### 📖 Overview
The **Shadow Puppet Simulator** is a creative AI project that transforms live camera input into shadow art. Inspired by traditional puppetry, it uses **real-time computer vision** to detect objects and generate dot-based shadows of them.

### ✨ Features
- **Real-time shadow detection** using a live camera feed.
- **Dot-based artistic representation** of objects and gestures.
- High accuracy achieved through:
  - Edge detection
  - Morphological transformations
  - Adaptive thresholding
- Optimized for **low-light conditions** and **dynamic gestures**.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python (3.x)
- **Libraries:**
  - OpenCV (for computer vision)
  - Numpy (for array manipulation)
- **Algorithms Used:**
  - **Edge Detection:** Sobel and Canny algorithms.
  - **Thresholding:** Adaptive and global thresholding.
  - **Morphological Operations:** Erosion and dilation for noise reduction.
